# LiveThemeConverter
Script that converts Theme files for Ableton Live 10 to Ableton Live 12


## This script is made to convert old Ableton Live 10 Theme files to the new format used in Ableton Live 12.
It takes an input file (the old theme file that will be converted) and a reference file (will be used to determine missing elements)

The reference file HAS TO BE one of the current default themes in Ableton Live 12.
So depending on if the input theme is light or dark, the reference file should be 
either "Default Light Neutral Medium.ask" or "Default Dark Neutral Medium.ask", to avoid unreadable text, etc.
(Or any of the other corresponding default themes in `C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 12 Suite\Resources\Themes`)
